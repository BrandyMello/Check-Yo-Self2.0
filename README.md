## Check Yo Self
Below is the result of the final solo project in Mod 1 1904 at Turing School of Software and Design. With Check Yo Self you can create task lists for all those important events or goals you want to accomplish. Before you commit a tasks to a card, you can delete items or add as many items to the card as necessary. The card will grow with the height of your list. You can mark off each list item as you complete it, but you can't delete a card until all the items are checked off. You can mark a card urgent or change your mind. Everytime you come back to your Check Yo Self board, all your items will be waiting for you. They are saved in local storage. When you delete a card it will be removed from local storage. Set some goals and use Chack Yo Self to track your progress!
